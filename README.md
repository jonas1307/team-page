## Overview
![main-page](https://github.com/jonas1307/team-page/blob/main/.github/screenshot.jpg)

This project goal is implementing a responsive web page for introducing a company team. It was developed as a solution for a challenge from devchallenges.io.

For this solution, I created a [next.js](https://nextjs.org) project to improve my React development skills, and also made extensive use of CSS Grids to put in use this skill that I learned a while ago during the excellent [Jonas Schmedtmannâ€™s](https://codingheroes.io) Sass course.

I also took advantage of next.js API Routes to create an endpoint that returns the employees to be rendered on the app.

A live demo is available [here](https://team-page.jonas1307.vercel.app/).

## Features
This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/hhmesazsqgKXrTkYkt0U) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.
